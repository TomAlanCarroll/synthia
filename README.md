# Welcome Home with Synthia

*Authors: Geoff Khorn, Sarah Carroll, and Tom Carroll*

Synthia is a Synthetic Intelligent Assistant for your home.

We love to give our homes unique personality with furniture, decor and lighting. But what if we could take that personalization futher and interact with our homes?

Synthia is an intelligent assistant that sends you off in the morning with helpful reminders, then welcomes you home at the end of each day. This is done using motion detection triggered by a camera built into a Raspberry Pi. If motion is detected within a certain time range in the morning or evening, it will trigger functions to play a customized message.

Synthia is written in Python and the hardware is a Raspberry Pi 3, Pi NoIR camera, and a bluetooth speaker.
